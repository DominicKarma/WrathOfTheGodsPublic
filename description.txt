A random side project done as a means of enjoyment alongside bigger things. Implements a Noxus and light deity boss fight based on one of the Calamity Mod's old ideas.
Don't expect other such projects. If I make more it'll be because I want to.

This mod has not been extensively tested in multiplayer. It has been programmed with it in mind but may still cause oddities.

The visual effects may be a bit extreme for some. If photosensitivity is a concern, or if you simply want it toned down a bit, refer to the configuration options.
