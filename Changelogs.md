# Version 1.1.12

- Fixed Nameless Deity hanging servers upon being summoned.
- Fixed secret vanilla world seeds (Such as 'for the worthy', 'get fixed boi', etc.) not working.
- Fixed render targets accidentally regenerating perpetually when not necessary. This should improve general mod performance.
- Updated the mod description to direct bug reports to the new public repository.
